Alchemy is the art of combining raw ingredients with matching effects to produce potions and oils of various kinds. The easiest way most Novizes start with is the brewing stand. 3 potions of the same kind can be produced depending on the ingredients combined in the apparatus. if brewed with gun powerder or dragon's breath, the potion can also used throw it or create a lingering effect area. In this book, I won't deepen the topic of brewing, due to it's beeing a Novices topic. As soon as potion brewing is mastered, an adept can start with creating oils on a cauldron. The take way more caution and attention to the exact amount of ingredients to work. If the count or some ingredients are missed at all, the process won't work. Such oils are very usefull when it comes to close combat, cause due to the oils thickness, it sticks on weapons for a long duration and can be used to deal additional damage to enemies subsceptible to the oil effect. In the following I will cite some common oils from the Lands Beyond:

Application:
Put all ingredients in the exact amount into a fully filled cauldron above a burning campfire and take water from it with an empty glas bottle. The ingredients only suffice for one single bottle of oil. The stronger the ingredients used, the stronger the oil and its effect on victims. Every Weapon can hold only one type of oil.

Base ingredient for all oils: Fish Oil - can be obtained by fishing during rain.
