My time is costly, and I highly doubt you can afford it\u2014but even beggars surprise me sometimes. Listen up, because I\u2019m only saying this once.\nIf you want to improve your equipment, you\u2019ll need to hold the item in your offhand and the corresponding reinforcement tool in your mainhand. There\u2019s one for melee weapons, one for armor and shields, and one for tools. Use it, and the quality will depend on your skill\u2014which, judging by the look of you, is close to nothing. But don\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll improve with repeated use.\nOh, and don\u2019t get any ideas\u2014 only unenchanted and still-unimproved equipment can be upgraded. Otherwise, you\u2019ll just ruin what little work you\u2019ve done. Now, if that\u2019s all, get out and go pester someone outside my shop."}]

How exhausting.\nFine, if this speeds up your exit\u2014me and my brothers craft the best, most durable equipment in all the Lands Beyond. I handle melee weapons, my brother Duncan does armor and shields, and young Finlay, against all odds, actually makes decent tools.\nNot that it matters to you, but moderate durability gear lasts twice as long, high durability four times, and very high durability? Eight times. Naturally, the better the gear, the higher the price\u2014far beyond whatever scraps you\u2019ve scrounged together.\nSo do yourself a favor: walk out that door, pretend you never had this conversation, and spare both of us the secondhand embarrassment."}]

Oh\u2026 you meant the furnace. Figures.\nThis blast furnace has stood for generations in my family, long before dullards like you ever laid eyes on true craftsmanship. I assume you don\u2019t even have a family tree, so don\u2019t go getting sentimental.\nIt can melt vast quantities of ore in no time at all. And because we\u2019re brilliant, we even refined our smaller blast furnaces to handle cobblestone, stone, sandstone, red sandstone, and sand far more efficiently than any common furnace.\nOf course, the peasant rabble just had to copy our work. Now any mud-covered simpleton in the land can do the same. A true tragedy, really. They have no appreciation for real craftsmanship!"}]

Oh, they\u2019d suit a peasant like you perfectly! No coin, but enough wood to fill a wagon\u2014 ha, ha, ha!\nWooden equipment does less damage, is unwieldy, breaks faster than a tavern brawl, and frankly, doesn\u2019t look like it could threaten a single rat. But hey, if you\u2019re really desperate and don\u2019t have coin for real weapons, you can always craft shields, maces, tridents, swords, axes... and other laughable excuses for tools.\nTell me, though\u2014 are you the new jester of the keep?

A deal our grandfather made with his family generations ago, and we\u2019re bound by it. Not that I think you could even afford a reasonable mount, but maybe you could scrape together enough for a donkey. A really old one. Ha, ha, ha!\nYou can also improve horse armor, if you\u2019re foolish enough to try. Just take a full block of the corresponding material and use a crafting table. A block of iron? Sure, that\u2019s simple enough, I suppose.\nIf you actually want the gear, go see him. But don\u2019t embarrass yourself too much\u2014better to use those muddy feet of yours than to think you\u2019re worthy of any of our true craftsmanship. Now, please, vanish.
